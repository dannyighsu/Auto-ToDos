# Smart Tasks
___

Smart tasks is a simple, automated task manager built in Google Sheets Apps Script.

## How does it work?
The spreadsheet is divided into **3** task sections:

1. To Do
 * List your prioritized to-dos here.
2. Backlog
 * Running behind on tasks, or simply lacking enough information to prioritize some to-dos right now? Drop those here.
3. Done
 * You're done! Keep a log of your accomplishments here.

## How do I use it?

Make a copy of this [sample spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GS9E0nEfKuQtreDpjgA9cygCil3OuLf6ZrB7pU552zU/edit?usp=sharing). The instructions are posted on the first tab, and everything is set up so you can get started right away. Done!

**Note**: The first time you hit the sort button, Google will ask you for authorization to allow the script to run. Unfortunately, I can't make this a Google-verified application since it's not tied to a web domain.

## Customization options
Navigate to Tools > Script Editor. You should see an editor pop up with the sortTasks.gs script. At the top of this you should find a few variables you can change to customize colors, keying, and sort behavior.
